# BlueSkyLinkSwapper

## Overview

BlueSkyLinkSwapper is a userscript designed to enhance your BlueSky experience. It automatically swaps standard BlueSky links with `fxbsky` links when you copy a post link via the share button. This can be especially useful for users who prefer the alternative BlueSky embed handling provided by `fxbsky`.

## Features

- **Automatic Link Conversion:** Converts BlueSky links to `fxbsky` links on share.
- **Broad Compatibility:** Works on various BlueSky domains including: Bsky.app
